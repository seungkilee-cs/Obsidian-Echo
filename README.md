# Obsidian Echo
Static page builder for Obsidian Vaults and Github pages

## Motivation
I wanted to see if there is a simple way to generate a static page that mimics the obsidian vault with its directory structure and navigation, but all I found was digital garden. Which is a great tool, but just a little different from what I actually wanted in my vault mirrors. So, I have decided to make this tool to allow users to host their configured vault directly on github pages, without using vercel or other kinds of hosting.
